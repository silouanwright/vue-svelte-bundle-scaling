  /**
   * HighlightLayer — 60fps optimized.
   *
   * Two visual pieces, expressed with {#if}/{#key} blocks and per-element
   * transitions:
   *  - dim overlay: mounted while a highlight is active / a step is on
   *    screen (Tween fades 0 → dimAmount on mount/step change, svelte-fade
   *    outro on removal)
   *  - clone layer: {#key visual.id} — swap on steps
   *
   * There is deliberately NO eraser panel under the clone: painting an
   * opaque box over the original text read as a black slab. Instead the
   * ORIGINAL token spans of the selection fade to opacity 0 in sync with
   * the dim (createHighlightUnderlay), so only the bright clone shows in
   * that spot — no box, no echo.
   *
   * Step changes OVERLAP: the incoming intro starts together with the
   * outgoing outro. Rendering never follows the async plan/measurement
   * pipeline directly — `visual` snapshots the last step that was fully
   * measured (identity-checked against its plan) and only swaps when the
   * INCOMING step is ready. Anything that was ever on screen therefore
   * keeps a real, measured clone that ALWAYS plays its outro; a click
   * landing mid-tokenize simply never mounts the skipped step (its intro
   * is what would have been killed, not the visible clone's outro).
   *
   * `onExitComplete` mirrors AnimatePresence: a counter is armed by every
   * outrostart AND every underlay restore, and released by its
   * outroend/restore-settle; when it drains to zero the callback fires
   * once (createHighlightNav's finishPending is idempotent, and its
   * fail-safe timer covers the "nothing animated" case). Restores are
   * part of the count so a queued slide morph never starts while an
   * original token span is still mid-restore or carrying the inline
   * transition that would break shiki-magic-move's class transitions.
