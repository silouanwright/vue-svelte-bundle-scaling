/**
 * stack-targeting — the pointer-based insertion math that keeps receiver
 * cards from hopping away from the cursor during slide-strip drags.
 *
 * The regression these lock in: svelte-dnd-action proposes reorder indices
 * from the dragged clone's CENTER, which crosses a card's midpoint before
 * the pointer is over that card. Applying those considers shifted the
 * receiver to the far side of the pointer on every approach. The strip
 * must instead pin the layout until the POINTER itself crosses a midpoint.
