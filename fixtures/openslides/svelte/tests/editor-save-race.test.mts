/**
 * Save-race regression suite — "type one char, caret teleports to the end".
 *
 * Root cause (user-reported, reproduced here in jsdom): CodeEditor's
 * auto-save fired independent mutations straight at the IPC layer. Two
 * saves could be in flight at once and the Rust side serves them from a
 * 5-connection SQLite pool, so an OLDER value could resolve LAST. Its
 * onSuccess then stamped the stale value into the query cache — and once
 * the localCode shadow was cleared, the editor rendered that older string,
 * the controlled textarea got a *different* value assignment, and the caret
 * was slammed to the end (a spec'd side effect of programmatic value
 * assignment). Worse: the DB row itself regressed — silent data loss.
 *
 * Fix under test:
 *   - src/lib/code-save.ts — serialized per-slide saves.
 *   - mergeSlidePreservingEditorCode in src/queries/slides.ts — settings
 *     responses can no longer carry a stale `code` column into the cache.
 *
 * The Svelte 5 CodeEditor additionally renders an UNCONTROLLED textarea
 * (value written once at mount, never again), so even a stale stamp can no
 * longer slam the caret. The harness mirrors that wiring faithfully (same
 * `localCode[slideId] ?? slide.code` expression, same onChange flow of
 * setLocalCode + mutation); only the 500ms debounce is replaced by manually
 * controlled mutation firing — the debounce was verified not to be the
 * culprit.
