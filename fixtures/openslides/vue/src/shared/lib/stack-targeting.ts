/**
 * Pointer-based insertion for the slide strip's dnd zone.
 *
 * Why this exists: svelte-dnd-action proposes its "would-be" insertion
 * index from the floating clone's CENTER (see the lib's helpers/observer +
 * helpers/listUtil). The clone's center crosses a card's midpoint up to
 * half a card-width BEFORE the pointer does (the gap is bigger the further
 * the grab point is from the card center). Applying those considers moved
 * the target card to the far side of the pointer — the "receiver runs
 * away" stacking bug: you chase the card, it hops again, forever.
 *
 * The strip therefore converts consider events into pointer-based
 * placement: the shadow may only advance to a slot the pointer itself has
 * reached, so a receiver card can never leapfrog the pointer. Combined
 * with the stack-zone hover suppression in the slide-strip dnd controller, hovering a
 * card pins it completely until you drop (stack) or leave (reorder
 * resumes).
